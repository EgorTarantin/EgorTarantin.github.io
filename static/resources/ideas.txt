Only HTML and CSS
basic idea --> cell like e.coli with parts in it with links to other pages with other parts 
Parts:
    1.  About me
        - Who am I?
        - what are my hobbies
        - my interests
        
    2.  Work and Experience
        - here just pace my work experience and maybe links??

    3.  News
        - here just news in my life (but only important stuff!! 

    4.  My projects sofar
        - here i paste work i did sofar (it or biology or other stuff)

Representation of this parts:
    1.  nucleous with DNA (maybe also some Transkription and translation
         to protein for part with about my inerests) 

    2.  Mythohondrium (a powerhouse of the cell!!) hehehe

    3.  Cell plasma

    4. extracellular space

General Idea:
    all should have light tones
    navbar should be at the top and show all the avalible links
    button at the side (only on subhome sites)
    
    general idea is: we are loking trought a mikroscope

    if somebody helps me --> mentioning him in point index and also all the links 
    paste there

    Sites:
    - index:    Small cell floating somewhere must be klikable with the link
                to overlook (homepage)
    
    - overlook: should show all main parts of our cell (i also should note that it is not 
                sized according to reality!)

    -DNA:        Point 1

    -Mythohondrium: Point 2

    - Plasma:   Point 3

    - extracellular: Point 4
